This repository contains code for the JMLR manuscript that proposes methods for learning expected and probabilistic constraints from constrained expert demonstrations.

Folders:
- `icl`: Contains code for ICL experiments (expected constraints), taken from [ashishgaurav13/ICL](https://github.com/ashishgaurav13/ICL)
- `prob_icl`: Contains code for IPCL experiments (expected and probabilistic constraints)

Just change directory into respective folder and see the corresponding readme for running the experiments.
